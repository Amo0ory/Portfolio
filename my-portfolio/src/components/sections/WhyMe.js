            I am passionate about self-development and continuously
             learn new things I have outstanding problem-solving 
             skills with the ability to work with technical and abstract concepts
              efficiently. 
              I also have extensive knowledge of JavaScript(ES6), React.js, React Native, C++ and C#. 
              I really want to learn and grow within a collaborative organisation. 
              For me itâ€™s not just about coding, it is about problem-solving as a team in an agile way
               to come up with the best solution for the business.
            I love a challenge, and as a self-motivated learner, 
            I really enjoy going above and beyond when it comes to tackling new tasks and learning new skills. 
            I work hard to develop collaboration and team bonding is an essential part of whatever work I am doing. 
            I am looking forward to hear back from you.
